# Keyless_Entry
A project in which I designed a system that allows older cars, or any vehicle that didn't had this option (it can be adapted to work in any other scenarios where you want keyless entry based on proximity for something with a lock) to have keyless entry and keyless start. It was designed to be a cheap , reliable, compatible with many devices  and secure diy option, that uses of the shelf parts like ESP32 and Arduino Mega, hardware components (tranzistors, ic's, basic electronic components) to interact with the car's interface and a propietary comunication protocol that had in mind and respected, from the designing phase, security concepts that a protocol schould have in order to block and prevent acces to the system from unautorised individuals. 
As a comunication channel this system uses Bluetooth Low Energy because of the small amount of data that need to be transfered between the client side (aka. the smart key) and the server that will run on the module inside the car and to use as little power as possible. All the data and protocol handshake steps are securely incripted with AES128 with a session key and a master key that is used as a shared secret.
